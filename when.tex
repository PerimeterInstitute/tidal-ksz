One of the main concerns about employing Cosmic Tidal Reconstruction is that it may import additional noise.

Now I am going to address under which conditions, the gain of perform tidal reconstruction will far exceeds the loss.

First, let us demonstrate the different information encorporated in the foreground substracted density field and the tidal reconstructed field.
To better compare them, we calculate the velocity field directly from the foreground substracted field.
In Fig.\ref{fig:vmode}, the upper panel shows the 
correlation $r(k_\perp,k_\parallel)$ between the real velocity field $v_z^{real}$ from simulation and $v_z^{fs}$; 
the lower panel shows the
correlation r between $v_z^{real}$ and $\hat v_z$. The background color indicating the level of powerspectrum of $v_z^{real}$. 
As we can see, the tidal reconstruction procedure really retrieve the part of velocity that matters most.
Moreover, if we further calculate kSZ signal with the foreground substracted field, its correlation coefficient r with the original signal will be close to 0.

To better understand the reason, let's write Eq.(\ref{eq:ksz}) in Fourier space.\begin{eqnarray}
\Theta(\bm{k_\perp})\equiv \Theta(k_x,k_y,0)=\int d^3k \delta(\bm{k}) v_z(\bm{k_\perp}-\bm{k})\,
\end{eqnarray}

Since $v(\bm{k})\propto \delta(\bm{k})\frac{k_z}{k^2}$, its amplitudes drops much faster than $delta(\bm{k})$ when k gets larger, therefore could be consider as delta function in original signal when $k_\perp>>0.01$.
However, as the foreground contaminate the large scale signal, we loose the peak in delta function and hence select total different part of the $\delta$ in the mock kSZ signal.
On the other hand, when we perform the Tidal Reconstruction, we retrieve the modes with small $k_z$ and tolerable $k_\perp$, we partly recover the delta function, and get correlated signal.

The correlation coefficient is not very high, because the drawback that we lost the smallest $k_\perp$ modes. So there is a optimal situation, when we still have the information in k~0.1, then we would be able to retrieve better kSZ signal without tidal reconstruction.
