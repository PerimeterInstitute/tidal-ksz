We demonstrate the correlation effect of the reconstructed kSZ signal in Fig.\ref{fig:powermomen15}. The upper panel shows the powerspectrum of orginal kSZ signal $P_{kSZ}$, reconstructed kSZ signal from 21cm intensity mapping $P_{21cm}$ and the cross powerspectrum of this two field $P_{cross}$; 
and the lower panel demonstrates the correlation r between reconstructed kSZ signal $\hat\Theta$ and the orginal kSZ signal $\Theta$. 
As we can see, we have a stable 0.3 correlation from $l\sim 100$ to $l\sim 2000$, which indicates a detectable signal in real observations.
