We demonstrate the correlation effect of the reconstructed kSZ signal in
Fig.\ref{fig:kSZ}. The upper panel shows the powerspectrum of orginal kSZ signal $P_{kSZ}$, reconstructed kSZ signal from 21cm intensity mapping $P_{21cm}$ and the cross powerspectrum of this two field $P_{cross}$; 
and the lower panel demonstrates the correlation r between reconstructed kSZ signal $\hat\Theta$ and the orginal kSZ signal $\Theta$. 
The results of correlation are shown in Fig.\ref{fig:kSZ}.
The upper panel shows the powerspectrum of orginal kSZ signal $P_{kSZ}$, 
		powerspectrum of reconstructed kSZ signal $P_{21cm}$ from foreground
		substracted 21cm field with $R_\parallel = 15$ Mpc/h, after tidal
		reconstruction, 
		and the cross powerspectrum of this two fields $P_{cross}$; 		
The dark solid line in lower panel demonstrates the correlation r between original kSZ signal
		$\Theta$ and mock kSZ signal $\hat\Theta_{R_\parallel 15,tide}$ from
foreground substracted 21cm field with $R_\parallel = 15$ Mpc/h, after tidal
reconstruction.
As we can see, we have a stable 0.3 correlation from $l\sim 100$ to $l\sim 2000$, which indicates a detectable signal in real observations.
